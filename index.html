                professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Spain
                national team. Known for his aggressive play, ball retrieval ability and prolific goalscoring abilities, he
                is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders of all time, having formerly played for Real Madrid for
                sixteen seasons, winning four UEFA Champions League titles with the Spanish giants along with two UEFA
                European Championship titles and the 2010 FIFA World Cup with the national team.[3][4][5]

                After emerging through Sevilla's youth academy and spending two seasons with the senior side, Ramos moved to
                Real Madrid in the summer of 2005. Since then, he went on to become a mainstay for Real Madrid, and had won
                22 major honours, including five La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League titles, becoming one of La
                Liga's top goalscorers from a defensive position. He played a crucial part in the build-up to all four UEFA
                Champions League wins, being named in the competition Squad of the Season each time. He also scored the
                equaliser in the 93rd minute of the 2014 UEFA Champions League Final.
    
                Ramos has been named to the FIFPro World11 eleven times; a record for a defender, and the third-most
                all-time. He has also been elected to the UEFA Team of the Year nine times, also a record for a defender and
                the third-most of any player. Additionally, Ramos has been named La Liga's Best Defender a record five

        <p>Sergio Ramos captains two powerhouse teams - The Spanish National Team and Real Madrid. Both teams’
            rollercoaster of a season is documented through the lens of the press, fans and Sergio himself. Off the
            field, Sergio’s passions and family life stabilize him as he enjoys the every-day life as a father of three,
            a partner to his fiancée, Pilar Rubio, and as an Andalusian (or PRE) stud farmer.</p><br>
